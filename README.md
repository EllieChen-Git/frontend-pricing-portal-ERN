### Purpose

The purpose of Pricing Portal is to allow accurate manual image annotation of property features within apartment floor plans, to more effectively evaluate apartment pricing. In the future, this will also allow our client to incorporate this project with computer vision and machine learning.

---

### Target Audience

The target audience for our application is our client Skychute and professionals within the real estate industry. Another group of our target audience is other developers who are interested in image annotation techniques.

---

### Features

**1. Image Annotation** - Users can tag certain features of an image using one or more tags. The data will automatically be saved to the database every time a user modifies a tag. The users can indicate when the annotation of an image is finished by saving the amended image (all the tags are placed). After submitting the image, the users are not able to modify their tags.

**2. Basic Tag Management** - Users can create and delete tags for image annotation. Tags are globally accessible to users across the system.

**3. Role-based authentication** - Users have access to different elements of the application based on their roles (admin or regular users) and basic Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**4. Annotation Review** - Users can review annotation results, and decide to either approve or reject annotations (If an annotation is rejected, it will be sent back to users for re-annotation).

**6. Basic Image Metadata Management** - Users can add metadata to the image annotation through manually adding key and value pairs.

---

### Future Features

**1. Advanced Image Metadata Management** - Users will be able to upload a CSV document, which contains metadata of an image (including image URLs).

**2. Image Flow Management** - Users will be able to organise images hierarchically through the system (e.g. Projects -> Buildings -> Levels -> Apartments).

**3. Advanced Tag Management and Tag Search** - Users will be able to search from existing tags and modify/update tags during the image annotation process.

**4. Advanced Role-based Authentication** - On top of basic role-based authentication, admin users can be grouped into different admin teams. Admin users will not be able to see the projects created by other admin teams.

**5. Image Navigation** - Users will be able to zoom in and out the image and to drag the image for better user annotation experience.

### Client Communication

Initially, our client reached out to us on LinkedIn about this project idea. After several exchanges, Ellie and Nina went to the client's office for the first client meeting to discuss their requirements for the pricing portal system.

After that, the clients (the project manager and the lead engineer) and us (Robbie, Nina, and Ellie) have communicated through our slack channel. We had 4 meetings with our client during the whole project time and we also demonstrated our MVP to them to collect their feedback before we completed the project.

The lead engineer came to our presentation and also did manual testing on the spot for us, and the project manager sent us a video before the presentation. They are both very happy with our results and will incorporate our project in their future products.

### Project Management Methodology

For this project, we followed the agile methodology and use Kanban board to record our project management process. We would first list out all the tasks and use planning poker to categorize our tasks based on complexity and priority.

![](./docs/project-management/Kanban.jpg)

In terms of team collaboration, Nina has strong knowledge and background in the backend, so she designed our database schema and implemented the data structure for our application. Ellie and Robbie spent more time on frontend design and the documentation. From time to time, Ellie and Robbie also worked on some backend functions while Nina also helped with the front-end styling.

We distributed the major tasks based on features and created different branches for these features on our GitHub repos. Nina was in charge of image annotation (both backend and frontend), Ellie was on image uploading (both backend and frontend) while Robbie implemented different user components to make role-based authentication (admin and users) happened. Robbie also did testing of the application.
